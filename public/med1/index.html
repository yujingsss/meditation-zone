On each inhale, think “I am worthy,” and on each exhale, “I am enough.” Let each inhale draw in self-love and each exhale release what is no longer serving you. Take a few minutes to breathe and recite this mantra internally. Notice how you feel as you say these words to yourself.", "Imagine now that you could breathe into your heart and visualize love pouring out of your hands and into your heart.", "Let this love warm and permeate you from your heart center, filling the rest of your body.", "Feel a sense of comfort and calm traveling up through your chest into your neck and head, out into your shoulders, arms, and hands, and then down into your ribs, belly, pelvis, legs, and feet", "Allow a sensation of warmth to fill you from head to toe.
